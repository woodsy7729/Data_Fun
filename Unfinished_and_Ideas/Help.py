print ("Hello World") #Needs " " with ()
#it will probabbly ignore this.
It ignores if a triple double quote as well
#\n causes new line. ie This is the first line. \nThis is the second line
Can import things, such as random.
Can label messages ie mymessage= 'This is just an example'. Needs ' '
Then can print(mymessage)
Can use maths: + - / * **(power), % is remainder, = assign a value to something
ie a = 1, != not equal to, < >, & (and) are both sides true. Use if need both
sides to be true, or is if either left or right is true

while, needs :    Repeats code block when criteria is satisfied.
ie while a<10: etc
pass = skips over that line
range(x), gives numbers from 0 to x-1 (number before x)
can also use range (5, x), from numbers 5 to x-1
Can use range to limit things ie, for i in range (5): print (i). Remember :
input(), can get response from user.If a number is needed use int (). For vice
versa, turning a string into an integer use str()
 == gives true or false. 

elif: else if, used if the first condition isnt satisfied so it does something
if, if statement is true then something happens, if false use else, and tell
it to do somethign else.
break: allows code loop to stop
random.randint() (needs import random) chooses random number between a range." " "

s= "Hello, my name is jamie"
print (s)
print(len(s)) #prints the length of s
print(s[4]) #prints the 4th letter in s
print (s[3:7]) #prints letters 3 to 7
print (s{8:]) # prints letters 8 to te end. 

a = [ 'a', 'b', 'c'] #list
print (a)
a.append('d') #adds d to list
a.remove('c') #removes c from list
a.sort() # sorts in aplhabetical order
a.reverse() #sorts in reverse alphabetical order
